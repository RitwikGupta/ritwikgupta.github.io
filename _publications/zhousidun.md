excerpt: "China is training machine learning models to target American and Allied navel vessels, but how well do they work? In this paper, we train a state-of-the-art machine learning model on a leaked Chinese dataset that labels Aegis combat system components on military vessels. We propose a new methodology for open source assessment of adversary AI capabilities."

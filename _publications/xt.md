title: "xT: Nested Tokenization for Larger Context in Large Images"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/xt
excerpt: "xT is a framework which lets you model extremely large images (upwards of 30,000 x 30,000 pixels) end-to-end on contemporary GPUs. You get higher accuracy with fewer parameters and less memory used per region."

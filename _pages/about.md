Hello! I'm Ritwik and this is where I post my thoughts and things about my life. I'm currently a first year Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley co-advised by Drs. [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/) and [Shankar Sastry](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sastry.html). My focus is on efficient machine learning for humanitarian assistance and disaster response and the polciy surrounding the use of ML in developing areas.

I am also the Founder and President of [Neural Tangent](https://neuraltangent.com/), a company aimed at creating ML solutions to humanitarian assistance and disaster response problems. I also provide consulting in the space of machine learning, artificial intelligence, edge computing, and remote sensing.

Feel free to poke around the site and hopefully you find something thought provoking. If you're going to be stopping by CMU at some point, please reach out if you want a tour or just want to chat!

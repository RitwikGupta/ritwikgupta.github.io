My name is Ritwik Gupta and I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am a member of the [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) lab. My research focus is on computer vision for humanitarian assistance and disaster response, as well as the development of policies related to the use of machine learning in developing areas. I am co-advised by Drs. [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/) and [Shankar Sastry](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sastry.html). I am an AI Policy Fellow in the [Center for Security in Politics](https://csp.berkeley.edu/) under the advisement of [Sec. Janet Napolitano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Napolitano).

I am lucky to be able to spend time at Berkeley's [Human Rights Center](https://humanrights.berkeley.edu/home) as a Research Fellow, and am also endowed with a fellowship from Berkeley's [AI Policy Hub](https://cltc.berkeley.edu/program/ai-policy-hub/).

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am the Founder and President of [Neural Tangent](https://neuraltangent.com/), a company that uses machine learning to solve problems in the field of humanitarian assistance and disaster response. I also provide consulting services in the areas of machine learning, artificial intelligence, edge computing, and remote sensing.

I co-organize the [Berkeley AI Reseach Climate Initiative](https://ai-climate.berkeley.edu/) with [Medhini Narasimhan](https://medhini.github.io/), which brings together researchers to work on AI research through the lens of climate change and helps to translate that work into real-world applications. If you are interested in participating, please join our Slack group and send me a message.

If you would like to contact me, you can email me at firstlast@berkeley.edu. Please note that I am currently not accepting undergraduate students for research opportunities, although new opportunities may arise in the future.

Hello! I'm Ritwik and this is where I post my thoughts and things about my life. I'm currently a first year Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley. My focus is on efficient machine learning for humanitarian assistance and disaster response and the policy surrounding the use of ML in developing areas.

I am a member of the [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), co-advised by Drs. [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/) and [Shankar Sastry](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sastry.html).

I am also the Founder and President of [Neural Tangent](https://neuraltangent.com/), a company aimed at creating ML solutions to humanitarian assistance and disaster response problems. I also provide consulting in the space of machine learning, artificial intelligence, edge computing, and remote sensing.

I co-organize the [Berkeley AI Reseach Climate Initiative](https://ai-climate.berkeley.edu/) with [Colorado Reed](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cjrd/) and [Medhini Narasimhan](https://medhini.github.io/) which is focused on uniting researchers to work on more meaningful AI x Climate research, and transitioning that work into the field. If you are interested in participating, please join the Slack and send me a message!

Feel free to poke around the site and hopefully you find something thought provoking. If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email at firstlast@berkeley.edu.

Hello! My name is Ritwik Gupta and I am currently a second year Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley. My focus is on (1) efficient machine learning for humanitarian assistance and disaster response and (2) the development of policies surrounding the use of ML in developing areas.

I am a member of the [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), co-advised by Drs. [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/) and [Shankar Sastry](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sastry.html). On the policy side, I work with the [Center for Security in Politics](https://csp.berkeley.edu/) under the advisement of [Sec. Janet Napolitano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Napolitano).

I co-organize the [Berkeley AI Reseach Climate Initiative](https://ai-climate.berkeley.edu/) with [Colorado Reed](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cjrd/) and [Medhini Narasimhan](https://medhini.github.io/) which is focused on uniting researchers to work on more meaningful AI x Climate research, and transitioning that work into the field. If you are interested in participating, please join the Slack and send me a message!

I am also the Founder and President of [Neural Tangent](https://neuraltangent.com/), a company aimed at creating ML solutions to humanitarian assistance and disaster response problems. I also provide consulting in the space of machine learning, artificial intelligence, edge computing, and remote sensing.

You can contact me by email at <i>firstlast</i>@berkeley.edu. I am currently not looking for undergraduate students to work with, though new opportunities frequently arise.
